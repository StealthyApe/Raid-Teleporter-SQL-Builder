# Raid-Teleporter-SQL-Builder
Builds SQL queries for the Raid Teleporter Module

# How/Why to use
The 4 relevant tables to check are all located in acore_world.
Simply do a filter such as `MenuID >= 25000` to check if the range above is clear and you won't overwrite anything.
The Tables to check are `gossip_menu_option` , `broadcast_text` , `gameobject` , `gameobject_template`
